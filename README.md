# MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT 

## Description

## Assignment 1

For my first assignment in the Amazon Web Services it was expected of me to

* Host a website in S3 bucket
* Use Cloudformation to Launch an Amazon EC2 Web Server, create a remote access and install python and Docker using the remote access
* Deploy SQL Server Databases on Amazon RDS
* Build a Serverless Processing System
* Deploy a Simple Python Web Application with AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### S3 Bucket

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Millions of customers of all sizes and industries store, manage, analyze, and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize and analyze data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business and compliance requirements.

### EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up) to handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website traffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.
